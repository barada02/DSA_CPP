   Optimized approach to check if a number is even or odd

/*
The last bit of all odd numbers is always 1, while for even numbers itâ€™s 0. 
So, when performing bitwise AND operation with 1, odd numbers give 1, and even numbers give 0.

Note: Bitwise operators are extremely fast and efficient because they operate directly at the binary level, 
making them significantly faster than arithmetic or logical operations.
